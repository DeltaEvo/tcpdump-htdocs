  <H1>Season of Docs ideas</H1>

  <p>
    To complement (I guess!) the Google Summer of Code, Google has started a
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/">Season of Docs</a>
    to "Let's bring open source and technical writer communities together, to
    the benefit of both. "
  </p>

  <p>
    The TCPUMP group maintains the tcpdump packet decoder, and the libpcap capture
    library. libpcap is used by wide variety of <a href="related.html">network diagnostic tools</a>
    including the very
    popular <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    TCPDUMP contains two sets of Unix-style manpages: <a href="manpages/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump(1)</a>
    and <a href="manpages/pcap.3pcap.html">pcap(3pcap)</a>.  The later of
    which links to 60-some additional pcap pages.  In addition there is a set
    of <a href="linktypes.html">link types</a> which describe the kind of
    information and meta-information that can be found in pcap files,
    an ancient <a href="pcap.html">pcap tutorial</a>.  There is an ancient
    <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> which is hard to update and hard to add things
    to.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some ideas for things to redo:
    <ul>
      <li> rewrite the manpages to provide better reference, removing tutorial
        contents, but including "contract" promises</li>
      <li> create higher-level documentation (in HTML or markdown), with
        diagrams, to explain how to use libpcap to a programmer new to
        libpcap</li>
      <li> illustrate an actual example via an API walkthrough with libpcap.
        This could involve the tcpsplice code or something new.</li>
      <li> tuning for better performance of libpcap, advanced details on
        Linux memory mapped packet interfaces, how to use threads with
        libpcap</li>
    </ul>
