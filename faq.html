                        Q: A tcpdump command that's been running for a long time seems to be
                        leaking memory; its address space size seems to be increasing steadily
                        over time.  Why is this happening, and how can I keep it from leaking
                        memory?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        A: Run it with -S.  Otherwise, tcpdump keeps track of all the
                        connections it has seen so it can generate relative sequence numbers
                        rather than absolute sequence numbers.  This looks like a leak, but is
                        in fact just state accumulation.

                                only packets to or from my machine, or why do I not see all the traffic
                                I'm expecting to see from or to the machine I'm trying to
                                monitor?

                                This might be because the interface on which you're capturing is plugged
                                into a switch; on a switched network, unicast traffic between two ports
                                will not necessarily appear on other ports - only broadcast and
                                multicast traffic will be sent to all ports.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Note that even if your machine is plugged into a hub, the "hub" may be
                                a switched hub, in which case you're still on a switched network.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note also that on the Linksys Web site, they say that their
                                auto-sensing hubs "broadcast the 10Mb packets to the port that operate
                                at 10Mb only and broadcast the 100Mb packets to the ports that operate
                                at 100Mb only", which would indicate that if you sniff on a 10Mb port,
                                you will not see traffic coming sent to a 100Mb port, and <em>vice
                                versa</em>.  This problem has also been reported for Netgear dual-speed
                                hubs, and may exist for other "auto-sensing" or "dual-speed" hubs.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Some switches have the ability to replicate all traffic on all ports to
                                a single port so that you can plug your analyzer into that single port to
                                sniff all traffic.  You would have to check the documentation for the
                                switch to see if this is possible and, if so, to see how to do this.
                                See <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/SwitchReference">the switch
                                reference page</a> on <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/">the Wireshark
                                Wiki</a> for information on some switches. (Note that it's a Wiki, so
                                you can update or fix that information, or add additional information on
                                those switches or information on new switches, yourself.)

                                Note also that many firewall/NAT boxes have a switch built into them;
                                this includes many of the "cable/DSL router" boxes.  If you have a box
                                of that sort, that has a switch with some number of Ethernet ports into
                                which you plug machines on your network, and another Ethernet port used
                                to connect to a cable or DSL modem, you can, at least, sniff traffic
                                between the machines on your network and the Internet by plugging
                                the Ethernet port on the router going to the modem, the Ethernet port on
                                the modem, and the machine on which you're running tcpdump into a hub
                                (make sure it's not a switching hub, and that, if it's a dual-speed hub,
                                all three of those ports are running at the same speed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If your machine is <em>not</em> plugged into a switched network or a
                                dual-speed hub, or it is plugged into a switched network but the port is
                                set up to have all traffic replicated to it, the problem might be that
                                the network interface on which you're capturing doesn't support
                                "promiscuous" mode, or because your OS can't put the interface into
                                promiscuous mode.  Normally, network interfaces supply to the host only:
                            </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        packets sent to one of that host's link-layer addresses;
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        broadcast packets;
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        multicast packets sent to a multicast address that the 
                                        host has configured the interface to accept.
                                    </li>

                                </ul>

                            <p>
                                Most network interfaces can also be put in "promiscuous" mode, in which
                                they supply to the host all network packets they see.  Tcpdump will try
                                to put the interface on which it's capturing into promiscuous mode
                                unless the <tt>-p</tt> option was specified.  However, some network
                                interfaces don't support promiscuous mode, and some OSes might not allow
                                interfaces to be put into promiscuous mode.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the interface is not running in promiscuous mode, it won't see any
                                traffic that isn't intended to be seen by your machine.  It
                                <strong>will</strong> see broadcast packets, and multicast packets sent
                                to a multicast MAC address the interface is set up to receive.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You should ask the vendor of your network interface whether it supports
                                promiscuous mode.  If it does, you should ask whoever supplied the
                                driver for the interface (the vendor, or the supplier of the OS you're
                                running on your machine) whether it supports promiscuous mode with that
                                network interface.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the case of token ring interfaces, the drivers for some of them, on
                                Windows, may require you to enable promiscuous mode in order to capture
                                in promiscuous mode.  Ask the vendor of the card how to do this, or see,
                                for example, <a
                                href="http://www.madge.com/_assets/downloads/lsshelp8.0/LSSHelp/AdvFeat/Promisc/Promisc2.htm">this
                                information on promiscuous mode on some Madge token ring adapters</a>
                                (note that those cards can have promiscuous mode disabled permanently,
                                in which case you <em>can't</em> enable it).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the case of wireless LAN interfaces, it appears that, when those
                                interfaces are promiscuously sniffing, they're running in a
                                significantly different mode from the mode that they run in when they're
                                just acting as network interfaces (to the extent that it would be a
                                significant effor for those drivers to support for promiscuously
                                sniffing <em>and</em> acting as regular network interfaces at the same
                                time), so it may be that Windows drivers for those interfaces don't
                                support promiscuous mode.

                            Q: Why can't I see any TCP packets other than packets to or from my   
                            machine, even though another sniffer on the network sees those packets?

                        <p>
                            You're probably not seeing <em>any</em> packets other than unicast
                            packets to or from your machine, and broadcast and multicast packets; a
                            switch will normally send to a port only unicast traffic sent to the MAC
                            address for the interface on that port, and broadcast and multicast
                            traffic - it won't send to that port unicast traffic sent to a MAC
                            address for some other interface - and a network interface not in
                            promiscuous mode will receive only unicast traffic sent to the MAC
                            address for that interface, broadcast traffic, and multicast traffic
                            sent to a multicast MAC address the interface is set up to receive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            TCP doesn't use broadcast or multicast, so you will only see your own
                            TCP traffic, but UDP services may use broadcast or multicast so you'll
                            see some UDP traffic - however, this is not a problem with TCP traffic,
                            it's a problem with unicast traffic, as you also won't see all UDP
                            traffic between other machines.

                        <p>
                            Tcpdump gets time stamps from libpcap, and libpcap gets them from the OS
                            kernel, so tcpdump - and any other program using libpcap, such as
                            Wireshark or snoop - is at the mercy of the time stamping code in the OS
                            for time stamps.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In most OSes on which tcpdump and libpcap run, the packet is time
                            stamped as part of the process of the network interface's device driver,
                            or the networking stack, handling it.  This means that the packet is not
                            time stamped at the instant that it arrives at the network interface;
                            after the packet arrives at the network interface, there will be a delay
                            until an interrupt is delivered or the network interface is polled
                            (i.e., the network interface might not interrupt the host immediately -
                            the driver may be set up to poll the interface if network traffic is
                            heavy, to reduce the number of interrupts and process more packets per
                            interrupt), and there will be a further delay between the point at which
                            the interrupt starts being processed and the time stamp is generated.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On some OSes, such as HP-UX, the OS kernel does not time stamp the
                            packet at all; instead, it's time stamped by libpcap at the time it
                            reads the packet from the OS kernel, which means that there will be an
                            even greater delay between the time the packet arrives and the time that
                            it's time-stamped.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thus, the packet time stamp is not necessarily a very accurate
                            indication of the time it arrived at the machine that captured the
                            packet.

                            At least on x86-based machines, Linux can get high-resolution time
                            stamps on newer processors with the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) register;
                            for example, Intel x86 processors, starting with the Pentium Pro, and
                            including all x86 processors since then, have had a TSC, and other
                            vendors probably added the TSC at some point to their families of x86
                            processors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Linux kernel must be configured with the CONFIG_X86_TSC option
                            enabled in order to use the TSC.  Make sure this option is enabled in
                            your kernel.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition, some Linux distributions may have bugs in their versions of
                            the kernel that cause packets not to be given high-resolution time
                            stamps even if the TSC is enabled.  See, for example, bug 61111 for Red
                            Hat Linux 7.2.  If your distribution has a bug such as this, you may
                            have to run a standard kernel from kernel.org in order to get 
                            high-resolution time stamps.

                            This is due to a bug in WinPcap.  The bug should be fixed in the WinPcap
