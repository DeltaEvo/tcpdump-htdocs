       or the snapshot length from the capture file, for a ``savefile''.

       It  must  not  be  called on a pcap descriptor created by pcap_create()
       that has not yet been activated by pcap_activate().

       ROR_NOT_ACTIVATED  if  called on a capture handle that has been created
       but not activated.
