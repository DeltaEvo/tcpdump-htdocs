PCAP_DUMP_OPEN(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_DUMP_OPEN(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_dump_open, pcap_dump_fopen - open a file to which to write packets

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_open(pcap_t *p, const char *fname);
       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_open_append(pcap_t *p, const char *fname);
       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_fopen(pcap_t *p, FILE *fp);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_dump_open()  is  called to open a ``savefile'' for writing.  fname
       specifies the name of the file to open. The file  will  have  the  same
       format  as those used by tcpdump(1) and tcpslice(1).  The name "-" is a
       synonym for stdout.

       pcap_dump_fopen() is called to write data to an  existing  open  stream
       fp.  Note that on Windows, that stream should be opened in binary mode.

       p  is  a  capture or ``savefile'' handle returned by an earlier call to
       pcap_create() and activated by an earlier call to  pcap_activate(),  or
       returned  by  an earlier call to pcap_open_offline(), pcap_open_live(),
       or pcap_open_dead().  The time stamp precision,  link-layer  type,  and
       snapshot  length  from  p  are used as the link-layer type and snapshot
       length of the output file.

       pcap_dump_open_append() is like pcap_dump_open but does not create  the
       file  if it does not exist and, if it does already exist, and is a pcap
       file with the same byte order as the host opening the file, and has the
       same  time stamp precision, link-layer header type, and snapshot length
       as p, it will write new packets at the end of the file.

RETURN VALUES
       A pointer to a pcap_dumper_t structure to use in subsequent pcap_dump()
       and  pcap_dump_close()  calls is returned on success.  NULL is returned
       on failure.  If NULL is returned, pcap_geterr(p) can be used to get the
       error text.
