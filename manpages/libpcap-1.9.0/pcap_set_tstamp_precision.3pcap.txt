PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_PRECISION(3PCAP)              PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_PRECISION(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision  -  set  the time stamp precision returned in
       captures

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_tstamp_precision(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_precision);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision() sets the precision of the  time  stamp  de-
       sired for packets captured on the pcap descriptor to the type specified
       by tstamp_precision.  It must be called on a pcap descriptor created by
       pcap_create()  that has not yet been activated by pcap_activate().  Two
       time stamp precisions are supported, microseconds and nanoseconds.  One
       can  use  options  PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO  and  PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECI-
       SION_NANO to request desired precision. By default, time stamps are  in
       microseconds.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision()  returns 0 on success if the specified time
       stamp precision is expected to be supported by  the  operating  system,
       PCAP_ERROR_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NOTSUP if operating system does not support
       requested time stamp precision, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED  if  called  on  a
       capture handle that has been activated.
