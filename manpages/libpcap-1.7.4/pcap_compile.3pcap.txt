PCAP_COMPILE(3PCAP)                                        PCAP_COMPILE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_compile - compile a filter expression

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_compile(pcap_t *p, struct bpf_program *fp,
               const char *str, int optimize, bpf_u_int32 netmask);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_compile() is used to compile the string str into a filter program.
       See pcap-filter(7) for the syntax of that string.  program is a pointer
       to  a  bpf_program struct and is filled in by pcap_compile().  optimize
       controls whether optimization on the resulting code is performed.  net-
       mask specifies the IPv4 netmask of the network on which packets are be-
       ing captured; it is used only when  checking  for  IPv4  broadcast  ad-
       dresses  in the filter program.  If the netmask of the network on which
       packets are being captured isn't known to the program,  or  if  packets
       are being captured on the Linux "any" pseudo-interface that can capture
       on more than one network, a value of PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN can  be  sup-
       plied; tests for IPv4 broadcast addresses will fail to compile, but all
       other tests in the filter program will be OK.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_compile() returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.  If  -1  is  re-
       turned, pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror() may be called with p as an argu-
       ment to fetch or display the error text.
