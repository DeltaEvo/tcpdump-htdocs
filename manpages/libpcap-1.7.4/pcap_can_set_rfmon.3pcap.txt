NAME
       pcap_can_set_rfmon  -  check whether monitor mode can be set for a not-
       yet-activated capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_can_set_rfmon(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_can_set_rfmon() checks whether monitor mode could be set on a cap-
       ture handle when the handle is activated.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_can_set_rfmon()  returns  0 if monitor mode could not be set, 1 if
       monitor mode could be set,  PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE  if  the  capture
       source  specified  when  the handle was created doesn't exist, PCAP_ER-
       ROR_PERM_DENIED if the process doesn't have permission to check whether
       monitor  mode  could  be supported, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if called on a
       capture handle that has been activated, or PCAP_ERROR if an  error  oc-
       curred.   If PCAP_ERROR is returned, pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror() may
       be called with p as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
