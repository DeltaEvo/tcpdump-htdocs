PCAP_ACTIVATE(3PCAP)                                      PCAP_ACTIVATE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_activate - activate a capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_activate(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_activate()  is used to activate a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network, with the options that were set  on  the  handle
       being in effect.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_activate()  returns  0  on  success  without  warnings, PCAP_WARN-
       ING_PROMISC_NOTSUP on success on a device that doesn't support  promis-
       cuous    mode   if   promiscuous   mode   was   requested,   PCAP_WARN-
       ING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP on success if the time stamp type specified in a
       previous  pcap_set_tstamp_type()  call  isn't  supported by the capture
       source (the time stamp type is left as the  default),  PCAP_WARNING  on
       success  with any other warning, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if the handle has
       already been activated, PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE if the capture source
       specified   when   the  handle  was  created  doesn't  exist,  PCAP_ER-
       ROR_PERM_DENIED if the process doesn't have permission to open the cap-
       ture  source, PCAP_ERROR_PROMISC_PERM_DENIED if the process has permis-
       sion to open the capture source but doesn't have permission to  put  it
       into  promiscuous  mode,  PCAP_ERROR_RFMON_NOTSUP  if  monitor mode was
       specified but the capture source doesn't support monitor mode, PCAP_ER-
       ROR_IFACE_NOT_UP if the capture source is not up, and PCAP_ERROR if an-
       other error occurred.   If  PCAP_WARNING  or  PCAP_ERROR  is  returned,
       pcap_geterr()  or  pcap_perror() may be called with p as an argument to
       fetch or display  a  message  describing  the  warning  or  error.   If
       PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP,   PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE,  or  PCAP_ER-
       ROR_PERM_DENIED is returned,  pcap_geterr()  or  pcap_perror()  may  be
       called  with p as an argument to fetch or display an message giving ad-
       ditional details about the problem that might be useful  for  debugging
       the problem if it's unexpected.
