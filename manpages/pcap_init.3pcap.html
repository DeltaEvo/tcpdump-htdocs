<H2>NAME</H2>

pcap_init - initialize the library
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;
</B>
<B>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
</B>
<B>int pcap_init(unsigned int opts, char *errbuf);
</B></PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_init</B>()

is used to initialize the Packet Capture library.
<I>opts</I>

specifies options for the library;
currently, the options are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PCAP_CHAR_ENC_LOCAL</B>

<DD>
Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all strings to the
caller, as being in the local character encoding.
<DT><B>PCAP_CHAR_ENC_UTF_8</B>

<DD>
Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all strings to the
caller, as being in UTF-8.
</DL>
<P>

On UNIX-like systems, the local character encoding is assumed to be
UTF-8, so no character encoding transformations are done.
<P>

On Windows, the local character encoding is the local ANSI code page.
<P>

If
<B>pcap_init</B>()

is not called, strings are treated as being in the local ANSI code page
on Windows,
<A HREF='/manpages/pcap_lookupdev.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_lookupdev</B></A>(3PCAP)

will succeed if there is a device on which to capture, and
<A HREF='/manpages/pcap_create.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_create</B></A>(3PCAP)

makes an attempt to check whether the string passed as an argument is a
UTF-16LE string - note that this attempt is unsafe, as it may run past
the end of the string - to handle
<B>pcap_lookupdev</B>()

returning a UTF-16LE string. Programs that don't call
<B>pcap_init</B>()

should, on Windows, call
<B>pcap_wsockinit</B>()

to initialize Winsock; this is not necessary if
<B>pcap_init</B>()

is called, as
<B>pcap_init</B>()

will initialize Winsock itself on Windows.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_init</B>()

returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
If -1 is returned,
<I>errbuf</I>

is filled in with an appropriate error message.
<I>errbuf</I>

is assumed to be able to hold at least
<B>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</B>

chars.
