<H2>NAME</H2>

pcap_init - initialize the library
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;
</B>
<B>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
</B>
<B>int pcap_init(unsigned int opts, char *errbuf);
</B></PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_init</B>()

is used to initialize the Packet Capture library.
<I>opts</I>

specifies options for the library;
currently, the options are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PCAP_CHAR_ENC_LOCAL</B>

<DD>
Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all strings to the
caller, as being in the local character encoding.
<DT><B>PCAP_CHAR_ENC_UTF_8</B>

<DD>
Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all strings to the
caller, as being in UTF-8.
</DL>
<P>

On UNIX-like systems, the local character encoding is assumed to be
UTF-8, so no character encoding transformations are done.
<P>

On Windows, the local character encoding is the local ANSI code page.
<P>

If
<B>pcap_init</B>()

is not called, strings are treated as being in the local ANSI code page
on Windows,
<A HREF='./pcap_lookupdev.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_lookupdev</B></A>(3PCAP)

will succeed if there is a device on which to capture, and
<A HREF='./pcap_create.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_create</B></A>(3PCAP)

makes an attempt to check whether the string passed as an argument is a
UTF-16LE string - note that this attempt is unsafe, as it may run past
the end of the string - to handle
<B>pcap_lookupdev</B>()

returning a UTF-16LE string. Programs that don't call
<B>pcap_init</B>()

should, on Windows, call
<B>pcap_wsockinit</B>()

to initialize Winsock; this is not necessary if
<B>pcap_init</B>()

is called, as
<B>pcap_init</B>()

will initialize Winsock itself on Windows.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_init</B>()

returns
<B>0</B>

on success and
<B>-1</B>

on failure.
If
<B>-1</B>

is returned,
<I>errbuf</I>

is filled in with an appropriate error message.
<I>errbuf</I>

is assumed to be able to hold at least
<B>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</B>

chars.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY</H2>

This function became available in libpcap release 1.10.0.  In previous
releases, on Windows, all strings supplied as arguments, and all strings
returned to the caller, are in the local character encoding.
