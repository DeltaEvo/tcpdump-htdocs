NAME
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision  -  set  the time stamp precision returned in
       captures

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_tstamp_precision(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_precision);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision()  sets  the  precision  of  the  time  stamp
       desired  for packets captured on the pcap descriptor to the type speci-
       fied by tstamp_precision.  It must be called on a pcap descriptor  cre-
       ated   by  pcap_create(3PCAP)  that  has  not  yet  been  activated  by
       pcap_activate(3PCAP).   Two  time  stamp  precisions   are   supported,
       microseconds  and  nanoseconds.  One can use options PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECI-
       SION_MICRO and PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO to request desired precision.
       By default, time stamps are in microseconds.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision()  returns 0 on success if the specified time
       stamp precision is expected to be supported by  the  operating  system,
       PCAP_ERROR_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NOTSUP if operating system does not support
       requested time stamp precision, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED  if  called  on  a
       capture handle that has been activated.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       This function became available in libpcap release 1.5.1.
