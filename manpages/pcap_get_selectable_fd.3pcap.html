pcap_get_selectable_fd - get a file descriptor on which a select() can
be done for a live capture

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</B>

returns, on UNIX, a file descriptor number for a file descriptor on
which one can
do a
<B>select()</B>

or
<B>poll()</B>

to wait for it to be possible to read packets without blocking, if such
a descriptor exists, or -1, if no such descriptor exists.  Some network
devices opened with
<B>pcap_create()</B>

and
<B>pcap_activate()</B>,

or with
<B>pcap_open_live()</B>,

do not support
<B>select()</B>

or
<B>poll()</B>

(for example, regular network devices on FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4, and Endace
DAG devices), so -1 is returned for those devices.
<P>

Note that in:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
FreeBSD prior to FreeBSD 4.6;
<DT><DD>
NetBSD prior to NetBSD 3.0;
<DT><DD>
OpenBSD prior to OpenBSD 2.4;
<DT><DD>
Mac OS X prior to Mac OS X 10.7;
</DL>
<P>

<B>select()</B>

and
<B>poll()</B>

do not work correctly on BPF devices;
<B>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</B>

will return a file descriptor on most of those versions (the exceptions
being FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4), but a simple
<B>select()</B>

or
<B>poll()</B>

will not indicate that the descriptor is readable until a full buffer's
worth of packets is received, even if the read timeout expires before
then.  To work around this, an application that uses
<B>select()</B>

or
<B>poll()</B>

to wait for packets to arrive must put the
<B>pcap_t</B>

in non-blocking mode, and must arrange that the
<B>select()</B>

or
<B>poll()</B>

have a timeout less than or equal to the read timeout,
and must try to read packets after that timeout expires, regardless of
whether
<B>select()</B>

or
<B>poll()</B>

indicated that the file descriptor for the
<B>pcap_t</B>

is ready to be read or not.  (That workaround will not work in FreeBSD
4.3 and later; however, in FreeBSD 4.6 and later,
<B>select()</B>

and
<B>poll()</B>

work correctly on BPF devices, so the workaround isn't necessary,
although it does no harm.)
<P>

Note also that
<B>poll()</B>

doesn't work on character special files, including BPF devices, in Mac
OS X 10.4 and 10.5, so, while
<B>select()</B>

can be used on the descriptor returned by
<B>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</B>,

<B>poll()</B>

cannot be used on it those versions of Mac OS X.  Kqueues also don't
work on that descriptor.
<B>poll()</B>,

but not kqueues, work on that descriptor in Mac OS X releases prior to
10.4;
<B>poll()</B>

and kqueues work on that descriptor in Mac OS X 10.6 and later.
<P>

<B>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</B>

is not available on Windows.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

A selectable file descriptor is returned if one exists; otherwise, -1
is returned.
