PCAP-CONFIG(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      PCAP-CONFIG(1)

NAME
       pcap-config - write libpcap compiler and linker flags to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       pcap-config [ --static ] [ --cflags | --libs | --additional-libs ]

DESCRIPTION
       When  run  with  the --cflags option, pcap-config writes to the standard output the -I compiler flags required to include
       libpcap's header files.  When run with the --libs option, pcap-config writes to the standard output the -L and -l  linker
       flags  required  to  link  with libpcap, including -l flags for libraries required by libpcap.  When run with the --addi-
       tional-libs option, pcap-config writes to the standard output the -L and -l flags for libraries required by libpcap,  but
       not the -lpcap flag to link with libpcap itself.

       By  default,  it  writes  flags appropriate for compiling with a dynamically-linked version of libpcap; the --static flag
       causes it to write flags appropriate for compiling with a statically-linked version of libpcap.
