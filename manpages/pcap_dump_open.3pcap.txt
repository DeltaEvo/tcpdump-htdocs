PCAP_DUMP_OPEN(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_DUMP_OPEN(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_dump_open, pcap_dump_fopen - open a file to which to write packets

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_open(pcap_t *p, const char *fname);
       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_open_append(pcap_t *p, const char *fname);
       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_fopen(pcap_t *p, FILE *fp);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_dump_open()  is  called to open a ``savefile'' for writing.  fname
       specifies the name of the file to open. The file  will  have  the  same
       format  as those used by tcpdump(1) and tcpslice(1).  The name "-" is a
       synonym for stdout.

       pcap_dump_fopen() is called to write data to an  existing  open  stream
       fp;   this   stream   will   be   closed   by   a  subsequent  call  to
       pcap_dump_close(3PCAP).  Note that on Windows, that  stream  should  be
       opened in binary mode.

       p  is  a  capture or ``savefile'' handle returned by an earlier call to
       pcap_create(3PCAP)   and   activated   by   an    earlier    call    to
       pcap_activate(3PCAP),    or    returned   by   an   earlier   call   to
       pcap_open_offline(3PCAP),           pcap_open_live(3PCAP),           or
       pcap_open_dead(3PCAP).   The time stamp precision, link-layer type, and
       snapshot length from p are used as the  link-layer  type  and  snapshot
       length of the output file.

       pcap_dump_open_append()  is  like  pcap_dump_open() but does not create
       the file if it does not exist and, if it does already exist, and  is  a
       pcap  file  with  the same byte order as the host opening the file, and
       has the same time stamp precision, link-layer header type, and snapshot
       length as p, it will write new packets at the end of the file.

RETURN VALUES
       A   pointer   to   a  pcap_dumper_t  structure  to  use  in  subsequent
       pcap_dump(3PCAP) and pcap_dump_close(3PCAP) calls is returned  on  suc-
       cess.    NULL   is   returned   on   failure.   If  NULL  is  returned,
       pcap_geterr(3PCAP) can be used to get the error text.
