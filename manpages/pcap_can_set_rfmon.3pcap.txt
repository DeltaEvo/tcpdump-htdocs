DESCRIPTION
       pcap_can_set_rfmon() checks whether monitor mode could be set on a cap-
       ture handle when the handle is activated.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_can_set_rfmon()  returns  0 if monitor mode could not be set, 1 if
       monitor mode could be set,  PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE  if  the  capture
       source   specified   when   the   handle  was  created  doesn't  exist,
       PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED if the process doesn't have permission to  check
       whether monitor mode could be supported, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if called
       on a capture handle that has been activated, or PCAP_ERROR if an  error
       occurred.   If  PCAP_ERROR  is returned, pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror()
       may be called with p as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
