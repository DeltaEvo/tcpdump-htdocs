<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_next_ex()</B>

reads the next packet and returns a success/failure indication.
If the packet was read without problems, the pointer pointed to by the
<I>pkt_header</I>

argument is set to point to the
<I>pcap_pkthdr</I>

struct for the packet, and the
pointer pointed to by the
<I>pkt_data</I>

argument is set to point to the data in the packet.  The
<I>struct pcap_pkthdr</I>

and the packet data are not to be freed by the caller, and are not
guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
<B>pcap_next_ex()</B>,

<B>pcap_next()</B>,

<B>pcap_loop()</B>,

or
<B>pcap_dispatch()</B>;

if the code needs them to remain valid, it must make a copy of them.
<P>

<B>pcap_next()</B>

reads the next packet (by calling
<B>pcap_dispatch()</B>

with a
<I>cnt</I>

of 1) and returns a
<I>u_char</I>

pointer to the data in that packet.  The
packet data is not to be freed by the caller, and is not
guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
<B>pcap_next_ex()</B>,

<B>pcap_next()</B>,

<B>pcap_loop()</B>,

or
<B>pcap_dispatch()</B>;

if the code needs it to remain valid, it must make a copy of it.
The
<I>pcap_pkthdr</I>

structure pointed to by
<I>h</I>

is filled in with the appropriate values for the packet.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_next_ex()</B>

returns 1 if the packet was read without problems, 0
if packets are being read from a live capture, and the timeout expired,
-1 if an error occurred while reading the packet, and -2 if
packets are being read from a ``savefile'', and there are no more
packets to read from the savefile.
If -1 is returned,
<B>pcap_geterr()</B>

or
<B>pcap_perror()</B>

may be called with
<I>p</I>

as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
<P>

<B>pcap_next()</B>

returns a pointer to the packet data on success, and returns
<B>NULL</B>

if an error occurred, or if no packets were read from a live
capture (if, for example, they were discarded because they didn't pass
the packet filter, or if, on platforms that support a read timeout that
starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires before any packets
arrive, or if the file descriptor for the capture device is in
non-blocking mode and no packets were available to be read), or if no
more packets are available in a ``savefile.''  Unfortunately, there is
no way to determine whether an error occurred or not.
