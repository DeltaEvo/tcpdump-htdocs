<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_next_ex()</B>

reads the next packet and returns a success/failure indication.
If the packet was read without problems, the pointer pointed to by the
<I>pkt_header</I>

argument is set to point to the
<I>pcap_pkthdr</I>

struct for the packet, and the
pointer pointed to by the
<I>pkt_data</I>

argument is set to point to the data in the packet.  The
<I>struct pcap_pkthdr</I>

and the packet data are not to be freed by the caller, and are not
guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
<B>pcap_next_ex()</B>,

<B>pcap_next()</B>,

<B>pcap_loop()</B>,

or
<B>pcap_dispatch()</B>;

if the code needs them to remain valid, it must make a copy of them.
<P>

<B>pcap_next()</B>

reads the next packet (by calling
<B>pcap_dispatch()</B>

with a
<I>cnt</I>

of 1) and returns a
<I>u_char</I>

pointer to the data in that packet.  The
packet data is not to be freed by the caller, and is not
guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
<B>pcap_next_ex()</B>,

<B>pcap_next()</B>,

<B>pcap_loop()</B>,

or
<B>pcap_dispatch()</B>;

if the code needs it to remain valid, it must make a copy of it.
The
<I>pcap_pkthdr</I>

structure pointed to by
<I>h</I>

is filled in with the appropriate values for the packet.
<P>

The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.  The
format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
<B>pcap_datalink()</B>

routine when handed the
<B>pcap_t</B>

value also passed to
<B>pcap_loop()</B>

or
<B>pcap_dispatch()</B>.

<I><A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html">http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</A></I>

lists the values
<B>pcap_datalink()</B>

can return and describes the packet formats that
correspond to those values.  The value it returns will be valid for all
packets received unless and until
<B>pcap_set_datalink()</B>

is called; after a successful call to
<B>pcap_set_datalink()</B>,

all subsequent packets will have a link-layer header of the type
specified by the link-layer header type value passed to
<B>pcap_set_datalink()</B>.

<P>

Do
<B>NOT</B>

assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have
any given link-layer header type, such as
<B>DLT_EN10MB</B>

for Ethernet.  For example, the &quot;any&quot; device on Linux will have a
link-layer header type of
<B>DLT_LINUX_SLL</B>

even if all devices on the system at the time the &quot;any&quot; device is opened
have some other data link type, such as
<B>DLT_EN10MB</B>

for Ethernet.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_next_ex()</B>

returns 1 if the packet was read without problems, 0 if packets are
being read from a live capture and the packet buffer timeout expired,
-1 if an error occurred while reading the packet, and -2 if packets
are being read from a ``savefile'' and there are no more packets to read
from the savefile.  If -1 is returned,
<B>pcap_geterr()</B>

or
<B>pcap_perror()</B>

may be called with
<I>p</I>

as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
<P>

<B>pcap_next()</B>

returns a pointer to the packet data on success, and returns
<B>NULL</B>

if an error occurred, or if no packets were read from a live capture
(if, for example, they were discarded because they didn't pass the
packet filter, or if, on platforms that support a packet buffer timeout
that starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires before any
packets arrive, or if the file descriptor for the capture device is in
non-blocking mode and no packets were available to be read), or if no
more packets are available in a ``savefile.'' Unfortunately, there is no
way to determine whether an error occurred or not.
