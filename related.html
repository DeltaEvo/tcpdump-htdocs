                            very complete. If you think your project should be
                            added to this list, please suscribe to the
                            tcpdpump-workers mailing list and send a request.
                            Requests must have the following subject "[Web]
                            Request for new related project" and must contain
                            the name of the project, a brief description
                            (between 200 and 500 characters), a link to the

<p>
Ecap (external capture) is a distributed network sniffer with a web front-end.

<p>
Ecap was written many years ago in 2005, but a post on the tcpdump-workers mailing list requested a similar application... so here it is. 

<p>
It would be fun to update it and work on it again if there's any interest.

                                Network Expect is a
                                framework that allows to easily build tools that
                                can interact with network traffic. Following a
                                script, traffic can be injected into the network,
                                and decisions can be taken, and acted upon, based
                                on received network traffic. An interpreted
                                language provides branching and high-level
                                control structures to direct the interaction
                                with the network. Network Expect uses libpcap for
                                packet capture and libwireshark (from the
                                Wireshark project) for packet dissection tasks.

                                Libnet is a collection of routines to help with the construction and
                                handling of network packets.  It provides a portable framework for
                                low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection.  Libnet
                                features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link
                                layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary
                                functionality.  Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly
                                applications can be whipped up with little effort.<br><br>

                                tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
                                connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for
                                protocol analysis or debugging.  A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
                                summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data
                                that's actually being transmitted.  In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs
                                the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for
                                later analysis.<br><br>

                                Combining the benefits of signature, protocol and
                                anomaly-based inspection, Snort is the most widely
                                deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide. With millions

                                users, Snort has become the de facto standard for

                                Bro is an open-source, Unix-based Network Intrusion
                                Detection System (NIDS) that passively monitors
                                network traffic and looks for suspicious activity.
                                Bro detects intrusions by first parsing network
                                traffic to extract its application-level semantics
                                and then executing event-oriented analyzers that
                                compare the activity with patterns deemed
                                troublesome. Its analysis includes detection of
                                specific attacks (including those defined by
                                signatures, but also those defined in terms of
                                events) and unusual activities (e.g., certain

                                Libcrafter is a high level library for
                                C++ designed to make easier the creation
                                and decoding of network packets. It is
                                able to craft or decode packets of most
                                common network protocols, send them on
                                the wire, capture them and match requests
                                and replies.
