                                Libnet is a collection of routines to help with the construction and
                                handling of network packets.  It provides a portable framework for
                                low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection.  Libnet
                                features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link
                                layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary
                                functionality.  Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly
                                applications can be whipped up with little effort.

                                TCPslice is a tool for extracting portions of packet
                                trace files generated using tcpdump's <code>-w</code> flag. It
                                can combine multiple trace files, and/or extract
                                portions of one or more traces based on time.
                                TCPslice originally comes from LBL and now is
                                maintained by The Tcpdump Group.

                                time-sequence graphs.

                                tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
                                connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for
                                protocol analysis or debugging.  A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
                                summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data
                                that's actually being transmitted.  In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs
                                the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for
                                later analysis.

                                anomaly-based inspection, Snort is the most widely
                                deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide. With millions
                                of downloads and approximately 300,000 registered
                                users, Snort has become the de facto standard for
                                IPS.

                                of a wide number of protocols, send
                                them on the wire, capture them, match

                                more. It can easily handle most
                                classical tasks like scanning,
                                tracerouting, probing, unit tests,

                                Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source, Unix-based Network Intrusion
                                Detection System (NIDS) that passively monitors
                                network traffic and looks for suspicious activity.
                                Zeek detects intrusions by first parsing network
                                traffic to extract its application-level semantics
                                and then executing event-oriented analyzers that
                                compare the activity with patterns deemed
                                troublesome. Its analysis includes detection of
                                specific attacks (including those defined by
                                signatures, but also those defined in terms of
                                events) and unusual activities (e.g., certain
                                hosts connecting to certain services, or patterns
                                of failed connection attempts).

                                A free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. It allows
                                you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file on
                                disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing summary
                                and detail information for each packet. Wireshark has several powerful
                                features, including a rich display filter language and the ability
                                to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.

                                CoralReef is a software suite developed by
                                <a href="https://www.caida.org/">CAIDA</a> to analyze data collected
                                by passive Internet traffic monitors.  It provides a programming
                                library libcoral, similar to libpcap with extensions for ATM and
                                other network types, which is available from both C and Perl.  The
                                software presently supports dedicated PC boxes using OC3mon and
                                OC12mon cards that collect traffic data in real time, as well as
                                reading from pcap tracefiles.  Version 3.4 to be released soon
                                supports listening via bpf enabled devices.  CoralReef includes
                                drivers, analysis, web report generation, examples, and capture
                                software.  This package is maintained by CAIDA developers with the
                                support and collaboration of the Internet measurement community.

                                data from a file.

                                common network protocols, send them on
                                the wire, capture them and match requests
                                and replies.

                                pcapfix is a repair tool for corrupted pcap and pcapng files. It checks
                                for an intact pcap global header and packet block and repairs it if there
                                are any corrupted bytes. If a header is not present, one is created and
                                added to the beginning of the file. It then tries to find pcap packet
                                headers or packet blocks, and checks and repairs them.

                                to the (now discontinued) WinPcap library, but has been largely
                                rewritten since then with hundreds of releases improving Npcap's
                                speed, portability, security, and efficiency.
