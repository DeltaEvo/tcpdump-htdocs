          To complement (I guess!) the Google Summer of Code, Google has started a
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/">Season of Docs</a>
          to "Let's bring open source and technical writer communities together, to
          the benefit of both."
        </p>

        <p>
          The Tcpdump Group maintains the tcpdump packet decoder and the libpcap capture
          library. libpcap is used by wide variety of <a href="related.html">network
          diagnostic tools</a>, including the very popular
          <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This web site contains two sets of Unix-style man pages:
          <a href="manpages/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump(1)</a>
          and <a href="manpages/pcap.3pcap.html">pcap(3pcap)</a>.  The later of
          which links to 60-some additional pcap pages.  In addition there is a set
          of <a href="linktypes.html">link types</a>, which describe the kind of
          information and meta-information that can be found in pcap files,
          an ancient <a href="pcap.html">pcap tutorial</a>.  There is a
          <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, which does not address all present day issues.

          Some ideas for things to redo:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rewrite the man pages to provide better reference, removing tutorial
              contents, but including "contract" promises.</li>
            <li>Create higher-level documentation, with
              diagrams, to explain how to use libpcap to a programmer new to
              libpcap.</li>
            <li>Illustrate an actual example via an API walkthrough with libpcap.
              This could involve the tcpsplice code or something new.</li>
            <li>Explain tuning for better performance of libpcap, advanced details on
              Linux memory mapped packet interfaces, how to use threads with
              libpcap.</li>
          </ul>
