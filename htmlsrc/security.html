                          Vulnerabilities reported to The Tcpdump Group via
                          security@tcpdump.org will be disclosed to the
                          public at the next release of tcpdump.

                        <p>
                          As a volunteer run open source organization, The
                          Tcpdump Group can not promise to release within a set
                          period like 90 days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Tcpdump Group aims to release twice a year,
                          usually in March and November of each year.  This
                          is a best effort commitment.  We will attempt to
                          ship more often but this will depend upon
                          availability of volunteer time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Each release will do its best to credit the
                          reporter with the identifying of the vulnerability.
                          Each reported issue will be given a CVE number at
                          the time of reporting.
                        </p>

                          Vulnerabilities found in unreleased public branches
                          may be reported and patched publically on GitHub.
                          Vulnerabilities found in released code SHOULD be
                          communicated with <a href="mailto:security@tcpdump.org">security@tcpdump.org</a>
