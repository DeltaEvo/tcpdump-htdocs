                <h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The direction field contains a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, if the packet was received by the machine;</li>
<li>1, if the packet was sent by the machine..</li>
</ul>
<p>If the uppermost bit of the packet type is set, the packet is a
compressed TCP packet.  Otherwise, the upper 4 bits of the packet type
are one of:
<ul>
<li>0x40, if the packet was an unmodified IP datagram;
<li>0x70, if the packet was a uncompressed TCP segment.
</ul>
<p>
If the packet was an uncompressed TCP segment, the lower 4 bits of the
packet type are the connection ID.  If the packet was a compressed TCP
segment, the packet type and compression information are the header of a
compressed TCP/IP datagram, as per Figure 5 of
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/rfc1144.pdf">RFC 1144</a>.
<p>
The payload begins with an IP header; regardless of the value of the
packet type, the IP and TCP headers are uncompressed.
