                <h3>Description</h3>
<p>
All multi-byte fields currently appear to be little-endian, but Apple
haven't indicated whether this is by design or merely a consequence of
all Apple machines that write this format being little-endian.
</p>
<p>
The length field indicates how long the PKTAP header is; this value
includes the length of the length field itself.  It should be
at least 108; if it's larger, there is additional data in the header
following the effective command name.
</p>
The record type field contains a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, if nothing follows the PKTAP header;</li>
<li>1, if a packet follows the PKTAP header.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The DLT_ value field contains an OS X DLT_ value for the packet, such as
DLT_EN10MB for an Ethernet packet.
</p>
<p>
The interface name contains a null-padded ASCII string giving the name
of the interface on which the packet arrived.  <em>Do not</em> assume
that there is a NUL character at the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
The flags field contains a set of currently-undescribed flags for the
packet.
</p>
<p>
The protocol family field contains a currently-undescribed value.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer header length field appears to contain the length of the
packet's link-layer header.  It may be 0.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer trailer length field is assumed to contain the length of
the packet's link-layer trailer.  It may be 0.
</p>
<p>
The process ID field contains the process ID of the process that sent
the packet; it may be 0 if the process ID is unknown.
</p>
<p>
The command name contains a null-padded ASCII string giving the last
component of the path name of the executable image running in the
process that sent the packet, truncated to 20 characters.  It may be
a null string if the executable image name is unknown. <em>Do not</em>
assume that there is a NUL character at the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
The service class field contains a currently-undescribed value.
</p>
<p>
The interface type field contains a currently-undescribed value.
</p>
<p>
The "unit number of interface" field is assumed to contain the unit
number of the interface.
</p>
<p>
The effective process ID field is assumed to contain a process ID of
some sort; it may be 0 if the process ID is unknown.
</p>
<p>

The effective command name contains a null-padded ASCII string giving
the last component of the path name of the executable image running in
some process, truncated to 20 characters.  It may be a null string if
the executable image name is unknown.  <em>Do not</em> assume that there
is a NUL character at the end of the name.
