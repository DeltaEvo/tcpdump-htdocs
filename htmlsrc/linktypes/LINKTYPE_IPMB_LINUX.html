                <h3>Description</h3>
<p>The lower 7 bits of the bus number + event flag field contain the bus
number; the upper bit indicates whether the packet is an event or a
regular packet - if it's set, the packet is an event.
</p>
<p>
The flags are in network byte order (big-endian).  The interpretation of
the flags depends on whether the packet is a regular packet or an event.
</p>
<p>
If the packet is a regular packet, the flag bits are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0x00000001 - if set, the packet is a read.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The upper 7 bits of the hardware address field contain the slave address
for the packet.  The payload is an IPMB packet.
</p>
<p>
If the packet is an event, the lower-order 16 bits indicate what type of
event this is:
<ul>
<li>0x00000001 - promiscuous mode was enabled;</li>
<li>0x00000002 - promiscuous mode was disabled;</li>
<li>0x00000004 - the I2C controller went online;</li>
<li>0x00000008 - the I2C controller went offline;</li>
<li>0x00000010 - the I2C controller attached to an I2C bus;</li>
<li>0x00000020 - the I2C controller detached from an I2C bus;</li>
<li>0x00000040 - the promiscuous data buffer overflowed, and some data
was lost;</li>
<li>0x00000080 - the promiscuous data buffer is no longer full;</li>
<li>0x00000100 - the incoming I2C data buffer overflowed, and some data was lost;</li>
<li>0x00000200 - the incoming I2C data buffer is no longer full;</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the "I2C controller went offline" error, the upper-order 16 bits
indicate that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0x00010000 - the I2C controller is unable to drive data LO;</li>
<li>0x00020000 - the I2C controller is unable to drive data HI;</li>
<li>0x00040000 - the I2C controller is unable to drive clock LO;</li>
<li>0x00080000 - the I2C controller is unable to drive clock HI;</li>
<li>0x00100000 - the I2C controller got a clock low timeout;</li>
<li>0x00200000 - the I2C controller was physically disconnected from the bus;</li>
<li>0x00400000 - an undiagnosed failure occurred;</li>
</ul>
