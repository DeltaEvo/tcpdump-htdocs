                <h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The packet type field is in network byte order (big-endian); it contains
a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, if the packet was sent to us by somebody else;</li>
<li>3, if the packet was sent to somebody else by somebody else;</li>
<li>4, if the packet was sent by us.</li>
</ul>
<p>For LAPD frames, the lower byte of the field is 0 for incoming
packets and 4 for outgoing packets.
<p>For log messages, if the lower byte of the field is 1, it's an
indication that one or more messages have been missed and not captured.
<p>
The ARPHRD_ type field is unused.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer address length field is unused.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer address field is unused.
</p>
<p>The protocol type field is in network byte order; it should contain
the value 0x0030.
