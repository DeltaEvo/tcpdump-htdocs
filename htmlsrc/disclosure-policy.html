                          Vulnerabilities report to TCPDUMP via
                          security@tcpdump.org will be disclosed to the
                          public at the next release of tcpdump.

                        <p>
                          As a volunteer run open source organization, The
                          Tcpdump can not promise to release within a set
                          period like 90 days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Tcpdump Group aims to release twice a year,
                          usually in March and November of each year.  This
                          is a best effort commitment.  We will attempt to
                          ship more often but this will depend upon
                          availability of volunteer time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Each release will do it's best to credit the
                          reporter with the identifying the vulnerability.
                          The best way to guarantee this is to include a
                          patch fixing the vulnerability with the disclosure
                          in the form of a pull request.
                          Each reported issue will be given a CVE number at
                          the time of reporting, as well as an <a href="">LGKI/GKH</a>.

                          Vulnerabilities found in unrelease public branches
                          may be reported and patched publically on github.
                          Vulnerabilities found in released code SHOULD be
                          communicated with <a href="mailto:security@tcpdump.org">security@tcpdump.org</a>
