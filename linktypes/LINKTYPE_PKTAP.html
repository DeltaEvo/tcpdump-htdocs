                <h3>Description</h3>
<p>
All multi-byte fields currently appear to be little-endian, but Apple
haven't indicated whether this is by design or merely a consequence of
all Apple machines that write this format being little-endian.
</p>
<p>
In the PKTAP version 1 header:
</p>
<p>
The length field indicates how long the PKTAP header is; this value
includes the length of the length field itself.  It should be
at least 108; if it's larger, there is additional data in the header
following the effective command name.
</p>
<p>
The record type field contains a value that is one of:
<ul>
<li>0, if nothing follows the PKTAP header;</li>
<li>1, if a packet follows the PKTAP header.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The DLT_ value field contains a macOS DLT_ value for the packet, such as
DLT_EN10MB for an Ethernet packet.
</p>
<p>
The interface name contains a null-padded ASCII string giving the name
of the interface on which the packet arrived.  <em>Do not</em> assume
that there is a NUL character at the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
The flags field contains a set of flags for the packet:
<ul>
<li>0x00000001 - packet is an incoming packet</li>
<li>0x00000002 - packet is an outgoing packet</li>
<li>0x00000004 - process is delegated</li>
<li>0x00000008 - interface is delegated</li>
<li>0x00002000 - header has a time stamp</li>
<li>0x00004000 - packet is from a new flow</li>
<li>0x00008000 - packet is a retransmission</li>
<li>0x00010000 - packet is a keep-alive packet</li>
<li>0x00020000 - packet is on a socket</li>
<li>0x00040000 - packet is on a nexus channel</li>
<li>0x00080000 - this packet has a version 2 PKTAP header</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The flags field is at the same offset in the version 1 and version 2
headers; it should be checked for the "version 2 PKTAP header" flag
before any other fields, including the length, are interpreted.
<p>
The protocol family field contains a value indicating the address
family of the packet.  It may be 0 for "unknown", 2 for IPv4, or 30 for
IPv6.  It may also be another macOS AF_ value; note that those values do
not necessarily correspond to the AF_ value of the operating system on
the host reading a capture.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer header length field appears to contain the length of the
packet's link-layer header.  It may be 0.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer trailer length field is assumed to contain the length of
the packet's link-layer trailer.  It may be 0.
</p>
<p>
The process ID field contains the process ID of the process that sent
the packet; it may be 0 if the process ID is unknown.
</p>
<p>
The command name contains a null-padded ASCII string giving the last
component of the path name of the executable image running in the
process that sent the packet, truncated to 20 characters.  It may be
a null string if the executable image name is unknown. <em>Do not</em>
assume that there is a NUL character at the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
The service class field contains one of the following values:
<ul>
<li>0, for "best effort",
<li>100, for "background system-initiated";
<li>200, for "background user-initiated";
<li>300, for "responsive data";
<li>400, for "operations, administration, and management";
<li>500, for "multimedia audio/video streaming";
<li>600, for "responsive multimedia audio/video";
<li>700, for "interactive video";
<li>800, for "interactive voice";
<li>900, for "network control".
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Note that these are priorities for which there is a total order; they
have different delay tolerance, loss tolerance, etc. characteristics.
</p>
<p>
<p>
The interface type field contains an SNMP ifType value for the
interface.
</p>
<p>
The "unit number of interface" field is assumed to contain the unit
number of the interface.
</p>
<p>
The effective process ID field is assumed to contain a process ID of
some sort; it may be 0 if the process ID is unknown.
</p>
<p>
The effective command name contains a null-padded ASCII string giving
the last component of the path name of the executable image running in
some process, truncated to 20 characters.  It may be a null string if
the executable image name is unknown.  <em>Do not</em> assume that there
is a NUL character at the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
The flow ID field contains a hash value computed for the flow to which
the packet belongs; it is 0 if there is no flow ID.
</p>
<p>
The IP protocol field contains a macOS IPPROTO_ value for the packet; it
may be IPPROTO_RAW if the packet was written to a raw socket.
</p>
<p>
All fields following the effective command name field are optional; the
length field indicates how many fields are present.
</p>
<p>
In the PKTAP version 2 header:
</p>
<p>
The length field indicates how long the PKTAP header is; this value
includes the length of the length field itself.  It should be
at least 108; if it's larger, there is additional data in the header
following the effective command name.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of UUID" field is 0 if the UUID field is not present;
otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP header
of the UUID field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of effective UUID" field is 0 if the effective UUID field is
not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP
header of the effective UUID field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of interface name" field is 0 if the interface name field is
not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP
header of the interface name field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of interface name" field is 0 if the interface name field is
not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP
header of the interface name field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of effective interface name" field is 0 if the effective
interface name field is not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the
beginning of the PKTAP header of the effective interface name field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of command name" field is 0 if the command name field is not
present; otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP
header of the command name field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of effective command name" field is 0 if the effective
command name field is not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the
beginning of the PKTAP header of the effective command name field. 
</p>
<p>
The DLT_ value field contains a macOS DLT_ value for the packet, such as
DLT_EN10MB for an Ethernet packet.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer header length field appears to contain the length of the
packet's link-layer header.  It may be 0.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer trailer length field is assumed to contain the length of
the packet's link-layer trailer.  It may be 0.
</p>
<p>
The interface type field contains an SNMP ifType value for the
interface.
</p>
<p>
The IP protocol field contains a macOS IPPROTO_ value for the packet; it
may be IPPROTO_RAW if the packet was written to a raw socket.
</p>
<p>
The protocol family field contains a value indicating the address

</ul>
</p>
<p>
Note that these are priorities for which there is a total order; they

</p>
<p>
The flow ID field contains a hash value computed for the flow to which
the packet belongs; it is 0 if there is no flow ID.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
